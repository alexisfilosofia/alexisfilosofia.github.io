# School Enrollment and Geospatial Analysis

A privacy-preserving portfolio project based on quantitative and geospatial analysis of historical school enrollment records.

This repository presents a sanitized version of an institutional analytics workflow. It combines enrollment trends, age distributions, course-level patterns, spatial concentration analysis, distance-to-school estimation, and aggregate sociodemographic indicators.

## Project goals

The project shows how Python can be used to transform fragmented institutional records into analytical outputs that support historical, educational and territorial interpretation.

The analysis focuses on:

- annual enrollment volume;
- age composition by year;
- age dispersion and outlier detection;
- entry course distribution by year;
- geospatial distribution of students;
- distance-to-school patterns;
- aggregate guardian nationality frequencies;
- privacy-aware reporting of sensitive educational data.

## Data privacy

The original datasets are not included.

They may contain sensitive institutional and student-level information such as names, addresses, family or guardian attributes and enrollment records. This public version includes only:

- sanitized notebooks;
- aggregate outputs;
- selected screenshots;
- methodological documentation.

No raw student-level dataset is published in this repository.

## Selected outputs

### 1. Annual enrollment volume

![Annual enrollment by year](assets/screenshots/01_total_enrollment_by_year.png)

This chart summarizes the total number of student records by registry year.

### 2. Age-range composition by year

![Age range distribution by year](assets/screenshots/02_age_range_distribution_by_year.png)

This stacked bar chart shows how the age composition of the enrollment records changes across years.

### 3. Age distribution and outlier detection

![Age boxplot by year](assets/screenshots/03_age_boxplot_by_year.png)

This boxplot allows comparison of median age, dispersion and outliers by year.

### 4. Entry course frequency by year

The public version includes the aggregated course-year table as CSV and HTML:

- [`assets/tables/course_year_heatmap_table.csv`](assets/tables/course_year_heatmap_table.csv)
- [`assets/tables/course_year_heatmap_table.html`](assets/tables/course_year_heatmap_table.html)

This output supports the analysis of how student entry patterns vary across years and courses.

### 5. Distance-to-school distribution

![Distance to school distribution](assets/screenshots/05_distance_to_school_distribution.png)

This histogram shows the approximate distance between student residences and the school, using aggregated geospatial calculations.

### 6. Guardian nationality distribution

![Guardian nationality distribution](assets/screenshots/06_guardian_nationality_distribution.png)

This chart summarizes guardian nationality frequencies at an aggregate level.

## How to use this repository

The notebooks are sanitized methodological versions. They document the analytical workflow without exposing the original sensitive files.

To adapt the project to another dataset:

1. Place anonymized or synthetic files in a local `data/` folder.
2. Adjust the data loading cells in the notebooks.
3. Keep row-level sensitive data out of public commits.
4. Export only aggregate tables, charts or anonymized spatial summaries.

## Ethical note

Educational and geospatial data can be sensitive, even when names are removed. Locations, nationality, family roles and institutional records can become identifying when combined.

For that reason, this repository is designed as a public portfolio version rather than a full data release.
